# Where to download the models
They are too big for GitHub, so I 7zip-ped them and uploaded them elsewhere. The baselines might not useful, but the links are:

[GDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11FnfTsWyE9UwG7pom34BnMtsGUqAovA5/view?usp=sharing)

[Mega](https://mega.nz/file/w4Qj2ILA#EW_jdTnJdFT-eAntQ6cxKwWJ45QdAT0uCFA4yiaxnBo)

### Poem time...
Where have all the models gone, long time passing?
Where have all the models gone, long time ago?
Where have all the models gone, 
Gone to GDrive everyone,
Oh why are they so goddamn big,
Oh why are they so goddamn big?

Where have all the drive space gone, long time passing?
Where have all the drive space gone, long time ago?
Where have all the drive space gone, 
Gone to models everyone,
Oh why are they so goddamn big,
Oh why are they so goddamn big?
