Therefore, it was used to check whether the baselines are showing =

some rough third-party verification of the project's outcomes.

a traditional approach (no dynamical data) can normally get. This =

of the ensemble obtained would likely be lower.=20

>   (7) In fact, the scores the baseline models give should not be much =
better than HKWW's, because the targets HKWW predict are ostensibly =
easier to predict.
> In conclusion, the best scores the experimental models and the =
ensemble could obtain would be between 0.845 ((1), (2), (7)) and 0.93 =
((3)-(6)). The 0.87 estimate was chosen to be conservative, because TC =
behaviour is likely more erratic than statistical models can accurately =
capture.
>=20
> > Is (the estimated) 0.87 score something you want to achieve?
> Yes, but it depends on the interpretations of the question. If it =
refers to the desirability of a score of 0.87 when there is sufficient =
data, then I would say that score is indeed satisfactory, though further =
improvements would be great. If it refers to some quantitative objective =
set at the beginning of the project (e.g. the project is not considered =
a success unless a score of 0.87 is reached), then I would say my answer =
is undefined. At the onset of this project, no estimations about the =
scores obtainable were ever made, as the correctness of the hypothesis =
(statistical-dynamical approach is better) had yet been verified, nor =
was the potential improvement margin understood.
>=20
> > Classification vs regression problem
> The goal is to find some probabilities of an event happening. The =
intuitive approach would be to consider the continuous probabilities as =
a target to obtain via regression analysis. Alternatively, given that =
the event's occurrence is binary and the input data is also labelled =
with these binary options, the problem could also be treated as a =
classification problem, where the models should identify whether the =
event would occur (yes or no). The key here is to also make the =
classifier produce a confidence score or a probability estimate. =
Therefore, the task of finding the probabilities can be done both by =
regression and classification. The disadvantages of either approach is =
that regressors may predict values outside of [0,1] which cannot be =
interpreted and classifiers may tend to predict values close to 0 or 1 =
but nothing in between. The advantages are the inverse of the =
disadvantages: regressors had slightly better probability calibration, =
but classifiers were easier to develop, test and optimize. Much of this =
project focused on classifiers because they were faster to develop and =
usually had consistently good performance.
>=20
> > Linear model and generalized additive models (GAMs)
> The main concept of GAM is to treat the target variable as a linear =
combination of some inputs, which may in turn be a function approximated =
using a number of splines, with some link function bridging between them =
(i.e. the link function is applied to the linear combination to obtain =
the predictions; ref.: Wikipedia =
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_additive_model>, pyGAM =
documentation =
<https://pygam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/tour_of_pygam.html>). =
It overcomes the weakness of linear models like linear regression and =
logistic regression where nonlinearities in the data are poorly =
modelled. In this project, the term "linear model" was applied to the =
general class of modelling methods that assume the output is some linear =
combination of the input.
>=20
> > Time series modelling: exogenous variables used
> The consideration was to rearrange the dataset into a time series-like =
structure, so that the target (endogenous) variables corresponded to the =
labels (Y) and the feature variables (X) were used directly as exogenous =
variables without further selection. Nonetheless, very little was =
actually done, e.g. the DIST00, DIST06, ..., DIST24 columns (TC center =
radial distance from Hong Kong over the last 24 hours) were simply =
brought together to give a DIST time series so the models could use =
them. This was to minimize changes made to the datasets, especially the =
columns, so that fairer comparisons were possible. The way the time =
series models function prevents retrieval of feature/exogenous variable =
importance values to further the analysis (e.g. filter out irrelevant =
variables), because that option is missing in the API =
<https://www.sktime.org/en/stable/api_reference/auto_generated/sktime.clas=
sification.interval_based.TimeSeriesForestClassifier.html>.
>=20
> > Multilayer perceptron (MLP) training configurations
> As many as 1000 epochs were allowed, but when training loss stopped =
improving for 10 consecutive epochs the training procedure would be =
halted. This was in accordance with scikit-learn's default MLP training =
behaviour (documentation links: classifier =
<https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.=
MLPClassifier.html>, regressor =
<https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.=
MLPRegressor.html>).
>=20
> > MLP regressors seem to be disproportionately bad
> This is because MLP regressors tended to overfit under the same =
hyperparameter settings when compared to MLP classifiers. This may be =
due to the models having different loss functions (mean squared error vs =
log loss), so comparing with the same hyperparameter settings could be =
unfair. Decreasing model complexity and strengthening regularization =
were considered, but owing to time constraints (each MLP regressor took =
about 3-6 hours to train, which made meticulous fine-tuning a =
time-consuming task) little tests could be made.
>=20
> > Usability
> An issue with the developed forecaster is that it is inconvenient for =
its potential users. The dynamical data must be manually fetched from =
the data source and manually preprocessed for each forecast, while =
making the forecast itself involves going into the source code and =
running the notebook cell by cell. If there were more automation and a =
simple user interface, where the users may submit input data without =
having to touch the source code (e.g. file uploads for dynamical data, =
web form for TC position data, etc.), then it would be much more =
convenient. The parameters of the models themselves are already fine and =
do not require further tuning (unless a new dataset is available, thus =
enabling further analyses, but this is in my opinion beyond the scope of =
the forecaster's usability).

estimate?<br class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">There are several factors =
taken into account: <br class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">&nbsp; (1) The =
HKWW reported score of 0.845 may represent the best results a =
traditional approach (no dynamical data) can normally get. This assumes =
that HKWW is trustworthy.<br class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">&nbsp; (2) =
The experimental models worked better than their baseline counterparts, =
therefore, it can be argued that if HKWW used dynamical data too, then =
the scores they would get would be above 0.845. <br class=3D""></div><div =
class=3D"">&nbsp; (3) The score improvements obtained by switching =
datasets were limited. The obtainable margin (in (2)) above 0.845 would =
not be as high as 0.1. <br class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">&nbsp; (4) =
The very high scores (0.93-0.96) obtained using 6500 experimental =
samples may represent overfitting, the actual performance of the =
ensemble obtained would likely be lower. <br class=3D""></div><div =
class=3D"">&nbsp; (5) If there were more samples, then the high variance =
issue (in (4)) could be corrected to some extent.</div><div =
class=3D"">&nbsp; (6) It was found that the models had better scores in =
general when only 6500 samples were available than when 45000 were. <br =
class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">&nbsp; (7) In fact, the scores the =
baseline models give should not be much better than HKWW's, because the =
targets HKWW predict are ostensibly easier to predict.<br =
class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">In conclusion, the best scores the =
experimental models and the ensemble could obtain would be between 0.845 =
((1), (2), (7)) and 0.93 ((3)-(6)). The 0.87 estimate was chosen to be =
conservative, because TC behaviour is likely more erratic than =
statistical models can accurately capture.<br class=3D""></div><div =
class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">&gt; Is (the estimated) =
0.87 score something you want to achieve?</div><div class=3D"">Yes, but =
it depends on the interpretations of the question. If it refers to the =
desirability of a score of 0.87 when there is sufficient data, then I =
would say that score is indeed satisfactory, though further improvements =
would be great. If it refers to some quantitative objective set at the =
beginning of the project (e.g. the project is not considered a success =
unless a score of 0.87 is reached), then I would say my answer is =
undefined. At the onset of this project, no estimations about the scores =
obtainable were ever made, as the correctness of the hypothesis =
(statistical-dynamical approach is better) had yet been verified, nor =
was the potential improvement margin understood.<br class=3D""></div><div =
class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">&gt; Classification vs =
regression problem</div><div class=3D"">The goal is to find some =
probabilities of an event happening. The intuitive approach would be to =
consider the continuous probabilities as a target to obtain via =
regression analysis. Alternatively, given that the event's occurrence is =
binary and the input data is also labelled with these binary options, =
the problem could also be treated as a classification problem, where the =
models should identify whether the event would occur (yes or no). The =
key here is to also make the classifier produce a confidence score or a =
probability estimate. Therefore, the task of finding the probabilities =
can be done both by regression and classification. The disadvantages of =
either approach is that regressors may predict values outside of [0,1] =
which cannot be interpreted and classifiers may tend to predict values =
close to 0 or 1 but nothing in between. The advantages are the inverse =
of the disadvantages: regressors had slightly better probability =
calibration, but classifiers were easier to develop, test and optimize. =
Much of this project focused on classifiers because they were faster to =
develop and usually had consistently good performance.<br =

 Linear model and generalized additive models (GAMs)<br =
class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">The main concept of GAM is to treat the =
target variable as a linear combination of some inputs, which may in =
turn be a function approximated using a number of splines, with some =
link function bridging between them (i.e. the link function is applied =
to the linear combination to obtain the predictions; ref.: <a =

href=3D"https://pygam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/tour_of_pygam.htm=
l" target=3D"_blank" class=3D"">pyGAM documentation</a>). It overcomes =
the weakness of linear models like linear regression and logistic =
regression where nonlinearities in the data are poorly modelled. In this =
project, the term "linear model" was applied to the general class of =
modelling methods that assume the output is some linear combination of =
the input.<br class=3D""></div><div class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div =
class=3D"">&gt; Time series modelling: exogenous variables =
used</div><div class=3D"">The consideration was to rearrange the dataset =
into a time series-like structure, so that the target (endogenous) =
variables corresponded to the labels (Y) and the feature variables (X) =
were used directly as exogenous variables without further selection. =
Nonetheless, very little was actually done, e.g. the DIST00, DIST06, =
..., DIST24 columns (TC center radial distance from Hong Kong over the =
last 24 hours) were simply brought together to give a DIST time series =
so the models could use them. This was to minimize changes made to the =
datasets, especially the columns, so that fairer comparisons were =
possible. The way the time series models function prevents retrieval of =
feature/exogenous variable importance values to further the analysis =
(e.g. filter out irrelevant variables), because <a =

 Multilayer perceptron (MLP) training configurations</div><div =
class=3D"">As many as 1000 epochs were allowed, but when training loss =
stopped improving for 10 consecutive epochs the training procedure would =
be halted. This was in accordance with scikit-learn's default MLP =
training behaviour (documentation links: <a =

 MLP regressors seem to be disproportionately bad</div><div =
class=3D"">This is because MLP regressors tended to overfit under the =
same hyperparameter settings when compared to MLP classifiers. This may =
be due to the models having different loss functions (mean squared error =
vs log loss), so comparing with the same hyperparameter settings could =
be unfair. Decreasing model complexity and strengthening regularization =
were considered, but owing to time constraints (each MLP regressor took =
about 3-6 hours to train, which made meticulous fine-tuning a =
time-consuming task) little tests could be made.<br class=3D""></div><div =

class=3D"">An issue with the developed forecaster is that it is =
inconvenient for its potential users. The dynamical data must be =
manually fetched from the data source and manually preprocessed for each =
forecast, while making the forecast itself involves going into the =
source code and running the notebook cell by cell. If there were more =
automation and a simple user interface, where the users may submit input =
data without having to touch the source code (e.g. file uploads for =
dynamical data, web form for TC position data, etc.), then it would be =
much more convenient. The parameters of the models themselves are =
already fine and do not require further tuning (unless a new dataset is =
available, thus enabling further analyses, but this is in my opinion =
beyond the scope of the forecaster's usability).<br class=3D""></div><div =
